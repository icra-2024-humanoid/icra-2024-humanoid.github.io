HumanMimic: Learning Natural Locomotion and Transitions for Humanoid Robot via Wasserstein Adversarial Imitation

##### Abstract



Transferring human motion skills to humanoid robots has been a longstanding challenge. In this study, we present a Wasserstein adversarial imitation learning system, allowing humanoid robots to achieve natural whole-body locomotion patterns as well as seamless transitions by mimicking human motions. First, we introduce a unified primitive-skeleton motion retargeting to mitigate morphological differences between several human demonstrators and humanoid robots. An adversarial critic component is integrated with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to guide the control policy to produce behaviors aligned with the data distribution of mixture reference motions. Additionally, we employ a specific Integral probabilistic Metric (IPM), namely the Wasserstein-1 distance with a novel boundary constraint to stabilize the training process and address model collapse. Our system is evaluated on a full-sized humanoid JAXON in the simulator, the control policy demonstrates a wide range of locomotion patterns including standing, push-recovery, squat walking, human-like straight-leg walking and dynamic running. Notably, despite the absence of transition motions in the demonstration dataset, robots showcase an emerging ability to naturally transition between distinct locomotion patterns as desired speed changes.
