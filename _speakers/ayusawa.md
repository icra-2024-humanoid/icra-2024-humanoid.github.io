##### Biography: 


[Ko Ayusawa](https://researchmap.jp/ko_ayusawa?lang=en) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mechano-informatics from the University of Tokyo, Japan, in 2006, 2008, and 2011, respectively. He worked with the Department of Mechano-Informatics at the University of Tokyo, as a postdoctoral researcher from 2011 to 2012, and as a project assistant processor in 2013. He is currently a researcher of Intelligent Systems Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan, and a researcher of CNRS-AIST JRL (Joint Robotics Laboratory), UMI3218/RL. His research interests include identification of human/humanoid dynamics, motion control for humanoid robots, and kinematics and dynamics simulation for human musculoskeletal models.

##### Abstract


Simulating human movements using humanoid robots and digital human models is an efficient approach to understanding human motor control. Motion optimization is one of the key techniques for generating and simulating movements in such humanoid systems. Since motion optimization requires the computation of physical quantities and derivatives, dealing with complex movements like locomotion becomes a difficult problem including modeling, kinematics, and dynamics. This talk will present a comprehensive framework for motion optimization, addressing various issues related to motion in humanoid systems. Several applications utilizing motion optimization will be introduced, such as human musculoskeletal analysis and human motion reproduction with a humanoid.
