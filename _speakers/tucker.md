##### Short Biography 

Hi, my name is [Maegan Tucker](https://maegantucker.com/). Iâ€™m an incoming Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech (starting January 2024) and currently a PhD candidate at Caltech, under the advisement of Dr. Aaron Ames. My research is centered around achieving stable and user-preferred locomotion on robotic assistive devices using formal methods from both nonlinear control theory and machine learning. My research has been supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the Caltech RoAMS initiative.
