Professor [Abderrahmane Kheddar](https://unit.aist.go.jp/jrl-22022/en/members/member-kheddar.html) received the BSCS from the Institut National d’Informatique, Algiers; MSc and PhD in robotics, both from the University of Paris 6. Currently, he is at CNRS and the Codirector of the CNRS-AIST Joint Robotic Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan. He is also leading the Interactive Digital Humans team at CNRS-University of Montpellier LIRMM, France. His research interests include haptics, humanoids and thought-based control using brain machine interfaces. He is a founding member of the IEEE/RAS chapter on haptics, the cochair and founding member of the IEEE/RAS Technical committee on model-based optimization. He is a member of the steering committee in charge of IEEE RAS liaison of the IEEE Brain Initiative, Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Robotics (2013–2018), Editor of IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (September 2019) and within the editorial board of other robotics journal. He is a founding member of the IEEE Transactions on Haptics (2007–2010). He is an IEEE fellow and titular full member of the National Academy of Technology of France and Knight in the National Order of Merits of France.
