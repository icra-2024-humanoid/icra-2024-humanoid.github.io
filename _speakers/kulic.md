##### Short Biography 


Prof. [Dana Kulić](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/danakulic) conducts research in robotics, learning and human-robot interaction (HRI). Dana Kulić received the combined B. A. Sc. and M. Eng. degree in electro-mechanical engineering, and the Ph. D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of British Columbia, Canada, in 1998 and 2005, respectively. From 2006 to 2009, Dr. Kulić was a JSPS Post-doctoral Fellow and a Project Assistant Professor at the Nakamura-Yamane Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, Japan. From 2009 - 2018, Dr. Kulić led the Adaptive System Laboratory at the University of Waterloo, Canada, conducting research in human robot interaction, human motion analysis for rehabilitation and humanoid robotics.  Since 2019, Dr. Kulić is a professor and director of Monash Robotics at Monash University, Australia. In 2020, Dr. Kulić was awarded the ARC Future Fellowship.

Online learning for gait modification

##### Abstract

Gait disorders are a common symptom of many illnesses, including stroke, Parkinson's disease, arthritis and other.  Gait disorders are commonly treated with rehabilitation.  To provide effective management and treatment, rehabilitation systems must adapt to the changing needs and capabilities of the user.  In this talk, I will describe an individualised approach using cueing to guide a user to modify their gait. During online interaction with the user, the system learns an individualised model of the user's responsiveness to cues, which is then used to generate appropriate cues.  The proposed approach is evaluated with healthy young adults, healthy older adults and Parkinson's disease patients.
